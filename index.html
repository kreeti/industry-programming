	  Importance of PROGRAMMING to Engineers / Scientist

	<section>
	  You can work faster by writing computer programs to automate tedious tasks.
	</section>
	<section>
	  You can go beyond using the tools as they are, and come up with more creative automated solutions.
	</section>
	<section>
	  You can communicate more easily with other programmers that your company may hire to do the coding

	  <h2>Imperative Programming</h2>
	  <p>Control flow in imperative programming is explicit: commands show how the computation takes place, step by step.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h2>Declarative Programming</h2>
	  <p>Control flow in declarative programming is implicit: the programmer states only what the result should look like, not how to obtain it.Imperative Programming</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
	  <p>OOP is based on the sending of messages to objects. Objects respond to messages by performing operations.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
	  <p>Control flow is expressed by combining function calls, rather than by assigning values to variables.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <h2>Higher-order functions</h2>
	  <p>The power of Functional Programming comes from being able to pass functions to functions, and also returning functions from functions.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  <p>There are no commands, only side-effect free expressions</p>
	  <p>Code is much shorter, less error-prone, and much easier to prove correct</p>
	  <p>There is more inherent parallelism, so good compilers can produce faster code</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	  So, go and learn a functional programming language.
